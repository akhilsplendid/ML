Introduction
This code compares the computational performance and predictive performance of three machine learning algorithms (random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machines) on the Spambase dataset. The evaluation measures are training time, accuracy, and F-measure. The comparison is based on stratified ten-fold cross-validation tests. The results are presented in tables and tested for statistical significance using the Friedman test and the Nemenyi post-hoc test.

Requirements
To run this code, you will need the following libraries:

sklearn
pandas
numpy
Running the code
To execute the code, simply run it using a Python interpreter. The code will automatically download the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, split it into features and target, standardize the features, and train and evaluate the algorithms using stratified ten-fold cross-validation. The results will be printed in tables, followed by the Friedman test and the Nemenyi post-hoc test.

Understanding the results
The tables show the values of the evaluation measures for each fold and algorithm. The last row of each table shows the average of the values and the standard deviation. The Friedman test is used to determine whether the average ranks of the algorithms as a whole are significantly different. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means that the algorithms do not perform equally. In this case, the Nemenyi post-hoc test is used to determine which pairs of algorithms significantly differ from each other. The critical difference is calculated based on the number of algorithms and the number of folds. If the difference between the average ranks of two algorithms is greater than the critical difference, the algorithms are considered to significantly differ from each other.
