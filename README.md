Machine learning course :
- Assignment 1: Implementation of concept learner 
    Procedure
    1) Identify a suitable preprocessing method for data transformation (continuous to discrete).  
    2) Compute 1) the size of possible instances, 2) the size of hypothesis space (the number of possible extensions), and 3) the size of hypothesis space, taking into           account only the number of possible conjunctive concepts according to the descriptions in Section 4.1 of the main literature.
    3) Implement the algorithm and verify that it works as expected.
    4) Compute the accuracy of the model and report the generated model, i.e., the conjunctive rule.
- Assignment 2:  Experimentally comparing the computational and predictive performance of three learning algorithms on a spam detection task.
Procedure (repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for each evaluation measure above)
    1) Run stratified ten-fold cross-validation tests.
    2) Present the results exactly as in the table in example 12.4 of the main literature.
    3) Conduct the Friedman test and report the results exactly as in the table in example 12.8 of the main literature.
    4) Determine whether the average ranks as a whole display significant differences on the 0.05 alpha level and, if so, use the Nemeyi test to calculate the critical          difference in order to determine which algorithms perform significantly different from each other.
